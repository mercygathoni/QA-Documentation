1. Introduction
Provide an overview of the purpose and scope of this document. Highlight the significance of testing for the project and identify key stakeholders involved.
2. Objective
Describe the tests that will measure system compliance with project specifications, including:
- Validating features detailed in the requirement documents.
- Confirming stability under load and stress conditions.
- Ensuring integration with external systems.
- Verifying security and usability requirements.
3. Test Scope

- In Scope
List the features, functionalities, and systems included for testing.
- Out of Scope
List the items that will not be tested.
- Output
- Test results
- QA Testing Reports
- Bug Reports
4. Types of Testing

- Unit Testing
Definition and approach for testing individual components.
- Integration Testing
Validation of interfaces and communication between system components.
- User Acceptance Tests (UAT)
End-user validation of system functionalities using real-world scenarios.
- Non-Functional Tests/Technical Testing
Testing performance, security, and technical system attributes.
5. Test Approach

- Testing Tools
List the tools used for testing, e.g., TFS, functional testing tools.
- Interfaces
Describe key interfaces and systems integrations required for testing.
- Environment
Specify testing environments, e.g., development, SIT, UAT.
- Access Requirements
List access requirements for testers.
6. Test Organization and Schedule

7. Test Case Development and Execution
Each test case will cover:
- Test case ID
- Test description
- Expected and actual results
- Pass/fail status
8. Defects Management
Defects shall be tracked and managed based on severity levels:
- Critical (P1): Must be fixed immediately.
- High (P2): Affects major functionalities and must be resolved.
- Medium (P3): Minor issues with workarounds.
- Low (P4): Cosmetic or non-impacting issues.
9. Risk and Contingency Plans
| ID | Risk Description | Mitigation Strategy | Severity |
|----|------------------|--------------------|----------|
| 1  | Inadequate test resources | Confirm resource availability in advance | High |
| 2  | Unstable test environment | Ensure environment stability | High |
| 3  | Integration delays | Early vendor engagement | High |
10. Assumptions and Dependencies
- Seamless system integration.
- Availability of test data and documentation.
- Adequate training for testers.
11. Quality Management
Quality Assurance (QA) will ensure that all test procedures and standards are followed.
12. Appendix A - Reference Materials
- Requirement documents
- Test case documentation
- Integration specifications
