To implement a fraud scoring model on an e-commerce payment gateway using Gherkin, you'll need to define your requirements and tests in a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) style. Gherkin syntax helps you describe the desired behavior of your application in a way that is understandable by all stakeholders. Below are the steps to achieve the implementation, including defining Gherkin scenarios for each step:

### 1. Data Collection
Define the scenarios for collecting relevant data needed for fraud scoring.

#### Gherkin Scenario Example for Data Collection

```gherkin
Feature: Data Collection for Fraud Scoring

  Scenario: Collect transaction data
    Given a customer initiates a payment
    When the transaction is processed
    Then the system should collect the transaction amount
    And the currency of the transaction
    And the time of the transaction
    And the location of the transaction
    And the frequency of transactions

  Scenario: Collect user data
    Given a customer has an account
    When the customer initiates a payment
    Then the system should collect the customer's account age
    And the customer's transaction history
    And the billing address
    And the shipping address

  Scenario: Collect device data
    Given a customer uses a device to make a transaction
    When the transaction is processed
    Then the system should collect the device's IP address
    And the device type
    And the browser information

  Scenario: Collect behavioral data
    Given a customer interacts with the e-commerce site
    When the customer browses and makes purchases
    Then the system should collect login frequency
    And browsing behavior
    And purchase habits
```

### 2. Define Risk Factors
Identify and define the risk factors to evaluate transactions.

#### Gherkin Scenario Example for Defining Risk Factors

```gherkin
Feature: Define Risk Factors for Fraud Scoring

  Scenario: Identify unusual purchase amounts
    Given a customer's transaction history
    When the transaction amount is significantly higher than the average
    Then flag the transaction as high risk

  Scenario: Identify high-risk locations
    Given a list of high-risk locations
    When a transaction originates from a high-risk location
    Then flag the transaction as high risk

  Scenario: Multiple failed transactions
    Given multiple failed payment attempts
    When there are several failed attempts in a short period
    Then flag the transaction as high risk

  Scenario: Mismatch in details
    Given a transaction's billing and shipping addresses
    When there is a mismatch between the addresses
    Then flag the transaction as high risk

    Given a transaction's IP address location and provided address
    When there is a mismatch between the locations
    Then flag the transaction as high risk
```

### 3. Develop the Fraud Scoring Model
Choose and develop the model(s) for fraud scoring.

#### Gherkin Scenario Example for Model Development

```gherkin
Feature: Develop Fraud Scoring Model

  Scenario: Rule-based model for fraud detection
    Given predefined rules and thresholds for fraud indicators
    When a transaction is evaluated
    Then apply the rules to assign a risk score

  Scenario: Machine learning model for fraud detection
    Given historical transaction data
    When training the machine learning model
    Then use supervised learning algorithms
    And create features based on the collected data
    And train the model with labeled data
    And validate the model with a separate dataset
```

### 4. Integrate the Model with the Payment Gateway
Implement the model within the payment processing workflow.

#### Gherkin Scenario Example for Model Integration

```gherkin
Feature: Integrate Fraud Scoring Model with Payment Gateway

  Scenario: Real-time fraud scoring
    Given a fraud scoring model
    When a transaction is processed
    Then score the transaction in real-time

  Scenario: API integration for external scoring service
    Given an external fraud scoring service
    When a transaction is processed
    Then send transaction data via API
    And receive a risk score from the service

  Scenario: Define thresholds for actions
    Given risk score thresholds
    When a transaction is scored
    Then if the score is low, approve the transaction
    And if the score is medium, require additional verification
    And if the score is high, block or flag the transaction
```

### 5. Monitor and Tune the Model
Continuously monitor and adjust the model's performance.

#### Gherkin Scenario Example for Monitoring and Tuning

```gherkin
Feature: Monitor and Tune Fraud Scoring Model

  Scenario: Track performance metrics
    Given implemented fraud scoring
    When transactions are processed
    Then track false positive rate
    And track false negative rate
    And track overall detection rate

  Scenario: Feedback loop for refinement
    Given feedback from manually reviewed transactions
    When analyzing the feedback
    Then use the feedback to refine the model

  Scenario: Regular updates to the model
    Given evolving fraud patterns
    When new data is available
    Then periodically retrain the model with the new data
```

### 6. Ensure Compliance and Data Security
Implement measures to protect data and comply with regulations.

#### Gherkin Scenario Example for Compliance and Data Security

```gherkin
Feature: Ensure Compliance and Data Security

  Scenario: Data encryption
    Given sensitive transaction data
    When data is transmitted or stored
    Then ensure the data is encrypted in transit
    And ensure the data is encrypted at rest

  Scenario: Compliance with regulations
    Given relevant regulations like PCI DSS and GDPR
    When handling transaction data
    Then ensure compliance with PCI DSS standards
    And ensure compliance with GDPR requirements
```

By defining these Gherkin scenarios, you can create a clear and structured approach to implementing a fraud scoring model on your e-commerce payment gateway. These scenarios can be used as the basis for developing automated tests and guiding the development process to ensure all necessary steps are covered.






















Demonstrate the concepts of overfitting and underfitting on a fraud scoring model on an e-commerce payment gateway model. This could be demonstrated by using a dataset that contains very little data (overfitting), and a dataset with poor feature correlations (underfitting).
Further to this for a given set of raw data, perform the data preparation steps as â€“ data acquisition, data pre-processing and feature engineering - to produce a dataset that will be used to create a classification model using supervised learning. This activity forms the first step in creating an ML model that will be used for future exercises. To perform this activity, I the students will be working with cucumber gherkin materials, including:  Libraries, ML frameworks, Tools and  development environment.

Split the previously prepared data into training, validation and test datasets. Train and test a classification model using supervised learning with these datasets. Explain the difference between evaluating/tuning and testing by comparing the accuracy achieved with the validation and test datasets
Using the classification model trained in the previous exercise, calculate and display the values for accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. Where applicable, use the library functions provided by your development framework to perform the calculations.         






### Sample AI Testing Model for Banking: Demonstrating Overfitting and Underfitting

#### Conceptual Model:
We'll create a classification model to predict whether a bank loan will be approved or not based on customer data. This model can be used to demonstrate overfitting and underfitting.

### Overfitting and Underfitting:
- **Overfitting**: When a model learns the training data too well, including noise and outliers, making it perform poorly on new, unseen data.
- **Underfitting**: When a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance on both training and testing data.

### Steps for Data Preparation:

1. **Data Acquisition**:
   - Collect raw data, which typically includes customer information such as age, income, credit score, employment status, loan amount, and whether the loan was approved or not.

2. **Data Pre-Processing**:
   - **Handling Missing Values**: Impute or remove missing values.
   - **Normalization/Standardization**: Scale numerical features to a standard range.
   - **Categorical Encoding**: Convert categorical variables into numerical form using techniques like one-hot encoding.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - **Creating New Features**: Generate new features from existing data to improve model performance (e.g., ratio of loan amount to annual income).
   - **Feature Selection**: Select relevant features that contribute most to the prediction to avoid overfitting and reduce dimensionality.

### Example Dataset Preparation

#### Raw Data Sample:
```plaintext
Age, Income, CreditScore, EmploymentStatus, LoanAmount, LoanApproved
25, 50000, 700, Employed, 20000, Yes
45, 100000, 800, Self-Employed, 15000, Yes
35, 65000, 600, Unemployed, 10000, No
```

#### Data Pre-Processing Steps:

1. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - Assume no missing values for simplicity. In practice, use techniques like mean/median imputation for numerical values or mode imputation for categorical values.

2. **Normalization**:
   - Normalize `Income`, `CreditScore`, and `LoanAmount` using Min-Max Scaling:
     ```python
     from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

     scaler = MinMaxScaler()
     data[['Income', 'CreditScore', 'LoanAmount']] = scaler.fit_transform(data[['Income', 'CreditScore', 'LoanAmount']])
     ```

3. **Categorical Encoding**:
   - One-hot encode `EmploymentStatus`:
     ```python
     data = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['EmploymentStatus'], drop_first=True)
     ```

4. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create new feature `LoanToIncomeRatio`:
     ```python
     data['LoanToIncomeRatio'] = data['LoanAmount'] / data['Income']
     ```

### Processed Data Sample:
```plaintext
Age, Income, CreditScore, LoanAmount, LoanApproved, EmploymentStatus_Self-Employed, EmploymentStatus_Unemployed, LoanToIncomeRatio
25, 0.25, 0.7, 0.4, Yes, 0, 0, 1.6
45, 1.0, 0.8, 0.3, Yes, 1, 0, 0.15
35, 0.65, 0.6, 0.2, No, 0, 1, 0.31
```

### Classification Model Using Supervised Learning:

#### Model Training and Evaluation:
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train a model (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression).
- Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Demonstrate overfitting by showing high accuracy on the training set but low accuracy on the testing set.
- Demonstrate underfitting by showing low accuracy on both the training and testing sets.

#### Example Code:
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Prepare data
X = data.drop('LoanApproved', axis=1)
y = data['LoanApproved'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == 'Yes' else 0)

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions
y_train_pred = model.predict(X_train)
y_test_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate
print("Training Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_train, y_train_pred))
print("Testing Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_test_pred))
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_test_pred))
```

### Integration with Cucumber and Gherkin for BDD:
You can write Gherkin scenarios to define the behavior of your model training and evaluation process, and use a testing framework like `Behave` in Python to automate these tests.

#### Example Gherkin Scenario:
```gherkin
Feature: Train and evaluate loan approval model

  Scenario: Model training and evaluation
    Given I have preprocessed the data
    When I train the Random Forest model
    Then I should see the training accuracy
    And I should see the testing accuracy
    And the model should not be overfitting or underfitting
```

### Libraries, ML Frameworks, and Tools:
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **ML Frameworks**: Scikit-learn
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, VSCode, Git
- **Development Environment**: Python, Node.js for Cucumber integration

This setup will help students understand the entire process of preparing data, training models, and evaluating their performance while integrating with BDD tools like Cucumber for comprehensive testing and validation.

Creating a predictive model to identify users who may default on paying their unsecured loans is a valuable application of machine learning in the banking industry. To begin, you'll need relevant data to train your model. Here's an outline of steps you can take:
1.	Data Collection: Gather data from your banking institution's databases or other relevant sources. Your dataset should include information about past unsecured loans and whether they were repaid or defaulted. Additionally, collect features such as:
â€¢	Demographic information (age, gender, marital status)
â€¢	Employment details (income, employment status)
â€¢	Loan-specific details (loan amount, interest rate, loan term)
â€¢	Credit history (credit score, past delinquencies)
â€¢	Financial behavior (credit card usage, savings account balance)



2.	Data Preprocessing: Clean the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This may involve imputing missing values, removing outliers, and encoding categorical variables. Ensure that the data is formatted correctly for analysis and modeling.
3.	Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve the predictive power of your model. For example, you could calculate debt-to-income ratio, create bins for age groups, or derive features from past loan repayment behavior.
4.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the relationships between different features and the target variable (loan default). Visualize the data using plots and graphs to identify patterns, correlations, and potential predictors of loan default.
5.	Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for your predictive modeling task. Common algorithms for binary classification tasks like loan default prediction include:
â€¢	Logistic Regression
â€¢	Decision Trees
â€¢	Random Forests
â€¢	Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
â€¢	Support Vector Machines (SVM)
6.	Model Training and Evaluation: Split your data into training and testing sets to train and evaluate your models. Use techniques such as cross-validation to assess model performance and mitigate overfitting. Evaluate models based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
7.	Model Deployment: Once you have a trained and evaluated model, deploy it in a production environment where it can make predictions on new loan applications. Monitor the model's performance over time and update it as necessary.
8.	Compliance and Ethical Considerations: Ensure that your modeling process complies with relevant regulations and ethical guidelines. Protect sensitive customer information and avoid bias in model predictions.
By following these steps, you can develop a predictive model that identifies users at risk of defaulting on their unsecured loans, helping your banking institution make more informed lending decisions and manage risk effectively.



Topic 6 â€“ Neural Networks and Testing
Students will be led through an exercise demonstrating a Perceptron learning a simple function, such as an AND function. The exercise should cover how a Perceptron learns by modifying weights across a number of epochs until the error is zero. Various mechanisms may be used for this activity (e.g., spreadsheet, simulation).

Sure, here's a structured exercise to demonstrate a Perceptron learning an AND function. This exercise will cover the basic concepts of Perceptron learning, weight adjustment, and epochs until the error is minimized to zero. 

### Objective:
Students will understand how a Perceptron learns by modifying weights through multiple epochs to learn a simple function like the AND function.

### Materials Needed:
- Computer with spreadsheet software (e.g., Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets) or a Python environment for simulation.

### Exercise Steps:

1. **Introduction to Perceptron:**
   - Explain the basic structure of a Perceptron: inputs, weights, bias, activation function (step function), and output.
   - Describe the AND function and its truth table:
     | Input 1 | Input 2 | Output (AND) |
     |---------|---------|--------------|
     |    0    |    0    |      0       |
     |    0    |    1    |      0       |
     |    1    |    0    |      0       |
     |    1    |    1    |      1       |

2. **Initialize the Perceptron:**
   - Start with random weights and a bias. For simplicity, initialize weights (w1 and w2) and bias (b) to 0.0.
   - Set the learning rate (Î·) to a small value, e.g., 0.1.

3. **Define the Activation Function:**
   - Use a step function:
     \[
     \text{output} = \begin{cases} 
      1 & \text{if } (w1 \cdot x1 + w2 \cdot x2 + b) \ge 0 \\
      0 & \text{otherwise} 
   \end{cases}
   \]

4. **Set Up the Learning Rule:**
   - Update rule for weights:
     \[
     w_i = w_i + \eta \cdot (d - y) \cdot x_i
     \]
     where \(d\) is the desired output, \(y\) is the actual output, and \(x_i\) is the input.

5. **Epochs and Training:**
   - Define an epoch as one full pass through all training examples.
   - Repeat the following steps for multiple epochs until the error is zero for all inputs.

### Practical Implementation (Using a Spreadsheet):

1. **Spreadsheet Setup:**
   - Columns: Epoch, Input 1 (x1), Input 2 (x2), Desired Output (d), Weight 1 (w1), Weight 2 (w2), Bias (b), Output (y), Error (d - y).

2. **Initialization:**
   - Fill the first row with initial weights (w1, w2, b = 0) and the learning rate.

3. **Calculation:**
   - For each training example (rows with inputs and desired outputs), calculate the Perceptron output and error.
   - Update weights and bias according to the learning rule.

4. **Update and Iterate:**
   - At the end of each epoch, update the weights and bias and log the new values for the next epoch.

5. **Convergence:**
   - Continue the process until the error for all inputs is zero.

### Example (First Few Steps):

1. **Epoch 1:**
   - Initial weights: w1 = 0, w2 = 0, b = 0
   - Learning rate: Î· = 0.1

| Epoch | x1 | x2 | d | w1 | w2 | b | y | d - y | New w1 | New w2 | New b |
|-------|----|----|---|----|----|---|---|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| 1     | 0  | 0  | 0 | 0  | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0     | 0      | 0      | 0     |
| 1     | 0  | 1  | 0 | 0  | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0     | 0      | 0      | 0     |
| 1     | 1  | 0  | 0 | 0  | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0     | 0      | 0      | 0     |
| 1     | 1  | 1  | 1 | 0  | 0  | 0 | 0 | 1     | 0.1    | 0.1    | 0.1   |

2. **Epoch 2:**
   - Updated weights: w1 = 0.1, w2 = 0.1, b = 0.1

| Epoch | x1 | x2 | d | w1 | w2 | b | y | d - y | New w1 | New w2 | New b |
|-------|----|----|---|----|----|---|---|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| 2     | 0  | 0  | 0 | 0.1| 0.1| 0.1| 1 | -1    | 0.1    | 0.1    | 0     |
| 2     | 0  | 1  | 0 | 0.1| 0.1| 0  | 0 | 0     | 0.1    | 0.1    | 0     |
| 2     | 1  | 0  | 0 | 0.1| 0.1| 0  | 1 | -1    | 0      | 0.1    | 0     |
| 2     | 1  | 1  | 1 | 0  | 0.1| 0  | 0 | 1     | 0.1    | 0.2    | 0.1   |

Continue the epochs until there is no error (d - y = 0) for all inputs.

### Conclusion:
By following these steps, students will see how a Perceptron adjusts its weights through learning and eventually correctly models the AND function. This exercise will help them understand the basics of neural network learning and the significance of epochs and weight updates.

Sure, here are concise definitions of epochs and weight updates in relation to a Perceptron:

### Epochs:
An **epoch** is one complete pass through the entire training dataset during the training process of a Perceptron or any other neural network. In each epoch, the Perceptron processes every training example once and updates its weights accordingly. Multiple epochs are often necessary to minimize the error and ensure that the Perceptron learns the underlying pattern or function from the training data.

### Weight Updates:
**Weight updates** refer to the adjustments made to the weights of the Perceptron after processing each training example. This adjustment is based on the error between the predicted output and the actual desired output. The update rule for a Perceptron's weights is typically derived from the gradient descent algorithm and can be expressed as:

\[ w_i = w_i + \eta \cdot (d - y) \cdot x_i \]

where:
- \( w_i \) is the weight associated with the \(i\)-th input.
- \( \eta \) (eta) is the learning rate, a small positive number that controls the magnitude of the weight adjustments.
- \( d \) is the desired output (target value).
- \( y \) is the actual output produced by the Perceptron.
- \( x_i \) is the \(i\)-th input value.

The goal of weight updates is to iteratively reduce the error by bringing the predicted output closer to the desired output, thereby improving the Perceptron's performance over time.

### Practical Implementation Example:

#### Epoch:
1. An epoch starts by initializing or using the current weights and bias.
2. The Perceptron processes each training example in the dataset sequentially.
3. After processing all training examples, the epoch ends, and the Perceptronâ€™s weights and bias have been updated based on the errors encountered.

#### Weight Update Example:
Consider a training example with inputs \( x1 \) and \( x2 \), desired output \( d \), and the Perceptronâ€™s weights \( w1 \) and \( w2 \):

1. Compute the Perceptron output \( y \) using the current weights and bias.
2. Calculate the error \( e = d - y \).
3. Update each weight using the rule:
   \[ w1 = w1 + \eta \cdot e \cdot x1 \]
   \[ w2 = w2 + \eta \cdot e \cdot x2 \]
4. Update the bias similarly (if applicable):
   \[ b = b + \eta \cdot e \]

By repeatedly performing these updates over multiple epochs, the Perceptron learns the desired function by minimizing the error across the training dataset.
